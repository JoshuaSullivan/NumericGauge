# NumericGauge

This is a UISlider replacement that allows for more precise value selection, even over large numeric ranges. It was inspired by a similar control in the Photos app. This framework has a
dependency on the [TransientLabel](https://github.com/JoshuaSullivan/TransientLabel) library to enable the inline value display.

It is provided for both UIKit and SwiftUI. Both versions are configured with a combination of `NumericGaugeLayout` which controls the rendering of the gauge and `NumericGaugeTheme` which
establishes the colors for the gauge and label.
